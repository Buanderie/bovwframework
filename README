This is an old project trying to implement and test a Bag-of-SpatioTemporal-Features 
for action classification and recognition.

It uses a spatio-temporal extension to SURF features for feature detection/description,
kNN for feature clustering and vocabulary building, 
as well as FANN (Fast Artifical Neural Network) for classification.

This project is kind of obsolete now, as my Action recognition effort will now focus more on OpenSTIP
